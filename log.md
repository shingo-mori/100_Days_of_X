# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read specifications for [The 2nd YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m-2018/data), downloaded sample datasets, read several kernels.

**Thoughts:** YouTube challenge is interesting, but the datasets are large (1.53TB!). Maybe I should start with [Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track).

**Link(s) to work:** None

### Day 2: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent 0.5 hour. Joined [Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track), downloaded datasets, briefly analyzed annotated images.

**Thoughts:** Several annotations are incorrect. These may harm the quality of the model. Been too busy to spare 1 hour...
